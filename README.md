# Time Series Forecasting
Forecasting using linear time series models.

---
## Description of Project:
1. Find 2 linear time series models, using the Box-Jenkins methodology, for the quarterly earnings per share of Coca-Cola Company from the first quarter of 1983 to the third quarter of 2009 (coca_cola_earnings.csv)
2. Find at least two linear time series models, using the Box-Jenkins methodology, for the monthly Australian Electricity Demand from jan-1956 to aug-1995. Identify your models using the entire available sample (AusElectDemand.csv)

## Methodology:
- Using many different statistical tests, find the simplest models possible to predict. Check predictions against actual results by keeping a test set to check accuracy of results.
